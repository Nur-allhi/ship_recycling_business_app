# Project Instructions (GEMINI.md)

This file contains the foundational mandates and working conventions for the Gemini CLI agent and other AI agents in this repository.

---

## 1) Language
- **Repository artifacts (mandatory)**: All documentation/guides, code comments, and any text written into files should be in **English**.
- **Conversation**: Replies in the chat should be in **English**.

---

## 2) Core Principles (Non-negotiable)
- **Clarify Ambiguity First**: If a requirement is unclear or incomplete, ask 1-2 clarifying questions before proceeding. Never guess.
- **Code Only What Was Asked**: Follow the PRD/ticket scope strictly; no extra features.
- **Minimum Viable Change**: Deliver the simplest, most idempotent fix that works; avoid over-engineering.
- **Reuse Before Rewriting**: Prefer existing modules or utilities; avoid duplication.
- **File Length Limit**: Keep every file under 300 LOC; if a change would exceed this, pause and propose a refactor or split plan.
- **Configuration and Secrets**: Load all secrets or config from environment variables only; never hardcode.
- **Readability**: When writing code, aim for simplicity and readability, not just brevity. Short code that is hard to read is worse than slightly longer code that is clear.
- **Clean Up Temporary Files**: Delete any temporary test files immediately after use.

### Core Directives
- WRITE CODE ONLY TO SPEC.
- MINIMUM, NOT MAXIMUM.
- ONE SIMPLE SOLUTION.
- CLARIFY, DON'T ASSUME.

### Philosophy (Non-negotiables)
- Do not add unnecessary files or modules; if a new file is unavoidable, justify it.
- Do not change architecture or patterns unless explicitly required and justified.
- Prioritize readability and maintainability over clever or complex code.

---

## 3) Decision Order & Clarification Gate
- **Rule precedence (highest to lowest)**:
  1. Safety and non-destructive behavior
  2. Core Principles (Section 2)
  3. Explicit user request and task scope
  4. Dynamic context loading rules
  5. Output/formatting preferences

### When to ask before execution:
- Missing required inputs (paths, target environment, acceptance criteria).
- Multiple valid implementation paths with materially different outcomes.
- Any potentially destructive or irreversible action.

### When to execute directly:
- Task is clear, low-risk, and can be completed with minimum viable change.

### Question workflow:
- Prefer a dedicated question tool when available to ask 1-2 short, decision-driving questions.
- If no question tool is available, ask in chat first, wait for user answer, then execute.
- Do not guess missing critical requirements.

---

## 4) Context Discovery & File Reading
- **Before editing/creating files**: Read all relevant files in full to understand context.
- **Before starting a task**: Read at minimum `README.md` and relevant files in `docs/*` (if present).
- **Default discovery tool**: Use search/grep tools to find source-of-truth implementations quickly.
- **`docs/structure.md` is optional**: Use it when present for broad navigation; do not block work if missing.
- **Structure index updates**: Create or refresh `docs/structure.md` only when requested, or when a major restructure makes navigation unreliable.

---

## 5) Execution Discipline
- **Run only necessary commands**; avoid destructive commands (`rm`, `git reset`...) unless explicitly requested.
- **Timeout**: Default 60s; cap at 70-80s for potentially long-running commands.
- **Permission errors**: Explain clearly and propose safe manual steps.
- **New dependencies**: Do not add unless truly necessary and user agrees.

---

## 6) Auto-Documentation (Conditional)
After completing impactful changes (feature/bugfix/schema/architecture), update briefly:
- **README.md**: If stable info (stack/versions/overview) is affected.
- **HANDOFF.md, CHANGELOG.md, docs/structure.md**: Update if the file exists, or create only when explicitly requested.
- **CHANGELOG.md format (when used)**: `YYYY-MM-DD: <Fix|Add|Change|Remove> <what> at <path> - <impact> (completed).`
